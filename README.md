# Cloud Services

This project contains several cloud services 
([Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) and [Bitwarden RS](https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs)) 
and uses [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) as a reverse proxy and [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) 
to update the services.

## Start

To get started read the individual READMEs, rename the `.env.sample` to `.env` and adapt it to your setup.
